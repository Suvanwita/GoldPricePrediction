# Gold Price Prediction ðŸ’°

A machine learning project that predicts the future price of gold based on historical market data using a Random Forest Regressor.
This project helps in understanding how financial data and regression models can be used to forecast commodity prices.

ðŸ“Œ Features

1. Predicts gold price using features like stock indices, oil prices, and exchange rates

2. Trains and tests data using Random Forest Regressor

3. Evaluates model accuracy using metrics such as RÂ² score and MAE

4. Visualizes feature correlations and model performance
